the Diabetes Mapping Project
~~ open source your diabetes ~~

This application allows users to signup and post anonymyzed versions of their diabetes treatment management logs. These logs can be uploaded and attached to their account to be compiled over time, focusing on five major variables, in order of importance to the project:

Glucose Readings (Blood or CGM)
Carbohydrate Intake
Insulin Units taken
Exercise Outputs
Stress Levels
A feature of the application will additionally allow anonymized users to interact with other users, seeking qualitative posts about their experience managing their treatment.

Optional user stats will be requested but not required, including: age, gender, zipcode, linked anonymous accounts (e.g., reddit), age at diagnosis, history of treatment, co-morbidities, what meds they are prescribed, any technologies or therapeutics used, their general regemin as prescribed by their care provider.

The application will include:

a signup/about page
a profile page
an upload posts page
a community forum (including a best of challenge)
a contact page

The about is simple, very clear and direct: create an ANONYMOUS profile, donate data by uploading photos (img uploader) or just posting your numbers (text), and play around by commenting or upvoting.
